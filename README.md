## Project Description
​
Using Javascript, CSS and good ol' HTML, I've built a functional quiz application. Starting with a landing page start button, you move through a quick explainer, and then into the quiz.

Some features include: 
- A 15 second timer per question.
- Disable answer selection after a selection is made.
- UI coloring for correct and incorrect answers.
- A fancy gif background!
- Some optional music to get you in the mood!
- A final score screen.

I was unable to get my highscore to display on the highscores page, so I removed the link. I hope to get this functional soon. 

I used multiple sources to build this application, starting and restarting over and over again, as my Javascript fluency is next to none. I couldn't have finished this without CodingNepal's excellent Quiz App tutorial on YouTube.
